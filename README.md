### Additional notes

1. Two versions of codes are provided:
   1. **Demo version** (demo_lof.py) is created for the fast reproduction of the experiment results. The demo version only compares the baseline algorithms with LSCP algorithms.
   2. **Production version** ([Python Outlier Detection (PyOD)](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)) is released with full optimization and testing as a framework. The purpose of this version is to be used in real applications, which should require fewer dependencies and faster execution.
2. It is understood that there are **small variations** in the results due to the random process, e.g., splitting the training and test sets. Thus, running demo codes would only result in similar results to the paper but not the exactly same results.

##  Introduction
In unsupervised outlier ensembles, the absence of ground truth makes the combination of base outlier detectors a challenging task. 
Specifically, existing parallel outlier ensembles lack a reliable way of selecting competent base detectors, affecting accuracy and stability, during model combination. 
In this paper, we propose a framework---called Locally Selective Combination in Parallel Outlier Ensembles (LSCP)---which addresses the issue by defining a local region around a test instance using the consensus of its nearest neighbors in randomly selected feature subspaces. 
The top-performing base detectors in this local region are selected and combined as the model's final output. 
Four variants of the LSCP framework are compared with seven widely used parallel frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that one of these variants, LSCP_AOM, consistently outperforms baselines on the majority of twenty real-world datasets.

## Conclusions

In this work, we propose four variants of a novel unsupervised outlier detection framework called Locally Selective Combination in Parallel Outlier Ensembles (LSCP). 
Unlike traditional combination approaches, LSCP identifies the top-performing base detectors for each test instance relative to its local region. 
To validate its effectiveness, the proposed framework is assessed on 20 real-world datasets and is shown to be superior to baseline algorithms. 
The ensemble approach *LSCP_AOM* demonstrates the best performance achieving the highest detection score on 13/20 datasets with respect to ROC-AUC and 14/20 datasets with respect to mAP. 
Theoretical considerations under the bias-variance framework and visualizations are also provided for LSCP to provide a holistic overview of the framework. 
Since LSCP demonstrates the promise of data locality, future work can extend this exploration by investigating the use of heterogeneous base detectors and more reliable pseudo ground truth generation methods.
